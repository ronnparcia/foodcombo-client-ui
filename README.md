# Y2 T3 College Project: Phase 1—Combo Meal Ordering System

A client user interface for ordering a combo meal—main, side, and drink. The system offers discounts for certain combos, allows the user to review their order, save the order in the database, and compute for their change. The [system for the administrator](https://github.com/ronnparcia/foodcombo-admin-ui) is created as a separate application.

This project is implemented using Flask, Jinja, and MySQL.

## General Instructions

Before running either the Phase 1 or Phase 2 application, import the [`db_machineproject.sql`](https://github.com/ronnparcia/foodcombo-admin-ui/blob/main/sql/db_machineproj.sql) database to **phpMyAdmin**. Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 use the same database.

1. Install **Python**
2. Using the command line, install the following Python packages using the  `pip`  package installer (built-in with Python). These are the frameworks, templating engines, and modules required for the application to run as intended:
   - Install **Flask**: `pip install flask`
   - Install **Jinja:** `pip install jinja2`
   - Install **MySQL Python Connector**: `pip install mysql-connector-python`
1. From the command line, change the working directory or `cd` to the folder containing the Phase 1 files (`phase1`)
2. Enter the command `python app.py` or `python3 app.py` to run the application on the localhost.
3. In your browser, enter the address `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the web application.
